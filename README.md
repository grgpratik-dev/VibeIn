# 🎶 VibeIn

VibeIn is a **moment-based music discovery mobile app** designed to solve a simple but overlooked problem in modern music streaming:

> Finding the *right* music for the moment you are in.

Instead of searching by genre, artist, or playlist, VibeIn lets users **capture a photo of their surroundings**, and then uses AI to generate a **one-time playlist** that matches the vibe of that specific moment.

> 💡 Built for moments that fade — but the music lingers.

## 🌍 The Idea

Music streaming platforms give access to millions of songs, but they often miss **context**.

Whether it’s a quiet sunset, a solo walk, or a focused work session, VibeIn focuses on **momentary music** — music that fits *now*, not your listening history.
